## Hi there 👋

My name is Sable. Here are some current side projects, notes, and other fun things to explore. I spend lot of my programming time using small tools and writing programs to help me get work done throughout the day.

Here are a few repos to check out.

- [AI Timeline](https://github.com/sc137/timeline-ai-llm)
- [Loan Comparison Tool](https://github.com/sc137/loan-comparison-tool)
- [Commander Life Tracker](https://github.com/sc137/CommanderLifeTracker)
