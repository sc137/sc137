## Hi there 👋

My name is Sable. Here are some current side projects, notes, and other fun things to explore. I spend lot of my programming time using small tools and writing programs to help me get work done throughout the day.

#terminal #vim #python

The Mt. SAC [CISW repository is here]([https://github.com/msac-cisw/](https://github.com/orgs/msac-cisw/repositories)).
